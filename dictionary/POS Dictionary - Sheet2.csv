Title,Description
Advocatus Diaboli,"(First mentioned in Dreamscapes, Memories, and Nightmares (Pt. 1))
(Requires a built Memory Palace) 
**Advocatus Diaboli**: A technique that allowed Snape to manifest a true secondary personality, one that was neither based on his own nor created from scratch. The Advocatus could give impartial advice and opinion on everything."
Perceptual Dilation / Time Dilation ,"(First mentioned in Home for the Holidays)
(Needs at least 2nd level mastery) **Perceptual Dilation** or ""*Fixing the Mind's Gaze Betwixt the Seven Beats of the Heart*"": 
This technique slows down your subjective awareness of time, allowing you to study surroundings more thoroughly and make decisions more efficiently. Can only be maintained for a duration equal to seven beats of the Occlumen's heart. "
Tabula Rasa (TR),"(From The Fall of the House of Potter (pt 2))
**Tabula Rasa**: A charm/curse invented to provide a humane alternative to the death penalty. 
Totally erases the subject's memories and eliminates their ability to make new ones. Virtually lobotomizes the subject. 

• Wizarding Australia uses it to ""psychically execute"" criminals convicted of capital crimes. They call it **Death of Personality**.

• Rookwood using incredibly advanced levels of occlumency has made him effectively immune to mind-alteration, emotional-manipulation, and memory-altering charms and potions of every kind. We also know that he is entirely immune to the Tabula Rasa. 

• It is possible that he created at least 49 thought-streams while serving time in Azkaban. Using this 49-stream matrix he is able to generate and implant false personalities through some combination of wanded magic and Legilimency instead of his former tactic of implanting them slowly over the course of months through his cursed books. 

• As long as Rookwood is free, the proliferation of sleeper-agents secretly loyal to Voldemort is a concern. [See More](https://prince-of-slytherin.fandom.com/wiki/Augustus_Rookwood ""Tip Toe Through the Tulips"")"
Cryptohydron and Time-Turner (CATT),"(From The Hunting of Sirius Black (Conclusion) AN5)
The **Cryptohedron** is a four-dimensional hypercube, and its changing shape is actually its three-dimensional shadow as it rotates, it houses the **Time-Turner** which is described as a glass tube that twists and turns back on itself, muggles would call it a Klein bottle. 

• The Cryptohedron's purpose is to identify the one person who can open it and direct the Unspeakables to them at the appointed time so it can be opened and the Time-Turner released. Both Time-Turner and container will be created at some point in the future and then sent back to the distant past. [See More](https://prince-of-slytherin.fandom.com/wiki/Time-Turner ""Time is an illusion to help things make sense"")"
Soul Bond Curse (SBC),"(From Potters and Blacks)
**Soul Bond**: ""A former Lord of House Potter, did *something*. Powerful *highly illegal* magic. The spell he casted acted as a curse on the Potter line designed to eliminate the possiblity of bad marriages to unworthy witches. It ensures that each Potter male will be drawn to the ideal marriage prospect — whatever Fate decided that meant in each successive generation — at which point he would fall hopelessly in love with her"". "
The Vault,"(First mentioned in Happy Birthday, Harry and Jim!) 
As a result of powerful and unnatural magics unleashed in 1927 (see `qd 7`), the place known as *Cimetière du Père-Lachaise*, near the Lestrange Mausoleum, became magic-proof. 

Inside there is **The Vault**, a large box roughly 10x10 meters, and is coated with a thin layer of orichalcum that is 65% pure. There is a single door on one side that resembles a bank vault door. It has been used by the Zabini family for decades for their most important divinations. It is a room no magic known can penetrate, standing in the middle of a dead zone where no magic can function. It was used by Zabini to read Harry's fortune in Book 4 in order to keep Fate itself from knowing about the reading. "
1927,"(From Happy Birthday, Harry and Jim!)
In 1927, Gellert Grindelwald did something extraordinarily evil, but also extraordinary from a magical perspective. And in response, Nicolas Flamel did something equally extraordinary, again magically speaking. The aftereffects of that night affected *Cimetière du Père-Lachaise* and the Lestrange Mausoleum making it magic-proof. This might roughly align with Crimes of Grindelwald where Grindelwald rallies his followers in the Lestrange Mausoleum [See More](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1927)"
Early Warning Office / DoM Chimes,"**The Early Warning Office**: contains the 57 Chimes, which alert the Unspeakables to the events occuring in Magical Britain. According to Unspeakable 029, Broderick Bode, many of them were warnings of fairly innocuous events, and the most banal simply duplicated the warning systems of other departments as backups, whereas other chimes were less weird and more nightmarish. [See More](https://prince-of-slytherin.fandom.com/wiki/Early_Warning_Office)

Common Department Abbreviations: 
• Department of Mysteries (DoM)
• Ministry of Magic / Minister of Magic (MoM)
• Department of Magical Law Enforcement (DMLE)
• Department of Magical Games and Sports (DMGS)
• Department Misuse of Muggle Artifacts  (MMA)
"
The Ewer of Hufflepuff,"(From The Riddle of the Diary)
**The Ewer of Hufflepuff**: created simultaneously with Slytherin's Basilisk will produce one full dose of the Restoration Potion every seventeen minutes."
PoS Horcruxes / Horcrux,"(From Three Princes)
For the full list (see `qd Known Horcruxes`)

A horcrux is a soul anchor. Creating a **horcrux** is esoteric magic, you must kill someone who did nothing to wrong you and you show no regret for having done so. That destabilizes your soul in such a way that it allows you to shear off a portion of it and store it inside a prepared magical object.. To *keep* a horcrux, you have to maintain a certain mindset constantly for the rest of your life and even *after death*. You must believe with absolute certainty that out of the entire human race, your life is the only one with any value. 

• In Regulus' words, ""If there is a single man, woman, or child in the entire world who you might refrain from brutally murdering in order to make a horcrux, then you would never be able to make a horcrux at all. Moreover, if something ever happened to cause you to feel that degree of empathy for anyoone else, any of your existing horcruxes would lose their soul-anchoring properties""

• After creating a horcrux you also gain access to whatever magical properties the object originally had even if the object isn't in your possession. If he horcux gets destroyed you permanently gain whatever those powers were. "
Ley Lines,"**Ley Lines**: Invisible, intangible, and largely theoretical lines that criss-cross the whole planet. Can't actually be detected themselves, but the places where they connect are magically reactive. It is possible to do high level magic more easily than other locations and works spells whose results will last infinitely. 

• Hogwarts, the Ministry of Magic, Diagon Ally, and 12 Grimmauld Place are located at a junction of ley lines.

• The British Isles possess an unusual number of such junctions and an extremely unusual number of junctions in which more than two ley lines intersect. That's why the original wizards came here from Rome in the first place. It's also why Magical Britain has influence over the rest of the magical world that's somewhat out of proportion to our population and the relative military and economic strength of the Muggle nation within which we reside. When push comes to shove, Britain can generate more raw magical power than all but a few of the other wizarding nations."
Orichalcum,"(First mentioned in The Birthday Part (Pt 1))
**Orichalcum**: An alchemically-produced alloy of gold and some other metal, usually copper or aluminum but sometimes silver or platinum. It's magic resistant, and if it's refined pure enough, it can slice through shield spells. 

• Commercially available orichalcum is usually rated at about 50% pure. If you're willing to spend a fortune, orichalcum that is 65% pure can be obtained. About sixty years ago, Nicolas Flamel produced approximately twenty grams of orichalcum that was 75% pure, and he declared that further refinement beyond that point was absolutely impossible.

• The box containing The Ring was made up of **>85%** pure orichalcum. There is literally not enough galleons in Wizarding Britain to pay for such purity. Withstood fiendfyre without so much as a scratch. Can only be opened by Harry speaking parseltongue. "
FiendFyre,"(From Little Hangleton)
• In somatic and verbal terms, it's the easiest dark spell ever invented. Just whirl your wand overhead in a circle and then point it at the target while screaming **'Fiendfyre!'**

• In order to satisfy the esoteric requirement you must focus your mind on a memory of hating someone so much that you would die to ensure their destruction. So much, that you would see everyone left that you still cared about die along with you. 

• Harry's and Regulus' fiendfyre flames take the shape of an enormous serpent and a wolf-like predator respectively. Described as daemonic antitheses of their patronuses. 

• It is not considered a unforgivable because there are Class XXXXX creatures who can only be harmed by Fiendfyre. If you've summoned Fiendfyre and your opponent kills you, its flames will run wild, destroying your assailant as revenge. Along with everything within a few miles. 
*Additionally, it can bend the Avada Kedavra by diverting it 3 degrees to the right from the point the curse strikes the hellfire*

• The immediate aftereffects of Fiendfyre are highly toxic. It takes at least a week for the residual curse-fire to dissipate enough to enter an area where Fiendfyre was recently cast, although long term exposure is toxic for years after."
Slytherin's Locket,"(From Meet Regulus Black)
The locket is described to be golden that bears a stylized ""S"" that usually appeared in depictions of Salazar Slytherin.

• Originally kept in a cave set in a seaside cliff near Clacton-on-Sea, Voldemort uses Kreacher to test if the trap he has set to defend the locket works. The cave is surrounded by a lake that hides an army of inferi.  

• Regulus Black commands Kreacher to lead him to the locket where Black drinks the foul potion designed to drive men mad. Then he charges his house-elf with destroying it. Due to the fatal thirst caused by the potion he is forced to drink from the inferi infested lake. He makes one last ditch effort to save himself and shapeshifts into Lord Voldemort (which scares the Inferi off) and manages to apparate away. 

• Regulus discovers that the horcrux cannot be destroyed by elf magic and he does not have the esoteric requirements at the time to destroy it with fiendfyre. He then chooses to flee to Australia under the name of ""Lazarus White"". 

• Harry uses parseltongue to open the locket after first learning from the S shaped snake on its front that Voldemort also used an object from Hufflepuff to make a Horcrux. The locket then takes the form of memories to torture both Harry and Regulus.

• Harry eventually destroys the Locket with a basilisk fang"
The Diary / Thaumaturgical Organizing Matrix,"(From Revelations in a Disused Lavatory) 
The Diary / **T**haumaturgical **O**rganizing **M**atrix: Created by Tom Marvolo Riddle to serve as a study aid. Notes can be organized and restructured however the user wishes. The diary can edit papers for both grammar and context, a magical grammarly if you will. Also can possess one Ron Weasley 

• Was created after the death of Myrtle and Tom's Occlumency induced sociopathy. It was created to be an entirely separate entity from Riddle, with its personality altered enough so that it was able to become his Secret Keeper for the Fidileus Charm housing the secret `Tom Marvolo Riddle is the dark wizard known as Lord Voldemort` 

• The Diary was destroyed by Harry in the Chamber of Secrets with the Sword of Gryffindor after it was coated in basilisk venom. Jim was also in the Chamber and both he and Harry became the secret keepers of Tom Riddle's secret after the diary was destroyed.
"
Hufflepuff's Cup,"Created by Helga Hufflepuff, she outlived the rest of the Founders by three decades. 
• Destroyed by Harry after he asked the group who wanted to keep it and who wanted to destroy it. Everyone in the room who had strong Occlumency defenses wanted to destroy the horcrux immediately, while everyone who *didn't* was making excuses for keeping it around indefinitely until they could figure out how to *use* it. 

• Bellatrix informed Harry that the Cup in currently in her vault at Gringotts and only she is able to recover it due to bio-magical signature security placed on the vault that she ensured was on the vault when her master entrusted her with a valuable item. One of these measures include the use of the  Flagrante-Gemino Curse.

• At its base has the words *Vinum Bibistus* inscribed which translates to *""Drink Wine""*. Lucius identifies the inscription from *Rubaiyat* a collection of 11th century poetry written by Omar Khayyam. The full [passage](https://libquotes.com/omar-khayy%C3%A1m/quote/lbt4u8r ""this is a real thing"") goes: ""*Drink wine. This life is eternal. This is all that youth will give you. It is the season for wine, roses, and drunken friends. Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life*"". "
Imago Dei,"(First mentioned in Investigating Into Dark Matters)
**Imago Dei** is a spell found in the Anathema Codex (see `qd 18`) It is a spell of Wild Magic (see `qd 20`) that can literally re-write reality to the caster's wishes. Its literal translation in English is 'Image of God'. 
• Imago Dei is the first spell from the Anathema Codex seen being performed ""on-screen"".
• The second is The Rune of Singular Hate which was used during the attack on Hogsmeade. 
[See More](https://prince-of-slytherin.fandom.com/wiki/Imago_Dei ""Image of God"")"
The Anathema Codex,"**The Anathema Codex** is a grimoire which contains various spells and rituals, relating to the summoning and usage of Wild Magic (see `qd 20`), which have been deemed too dangerous to society should they become public knowledge. It contains spells, rituals, potions, procedures for breeding unnatural beasts, and ancient runes.

Azkaban Conspiracy / Azkabal,"The **Azkaban Conspiracy**, also known as the **Azkabal**, was the group responsible for the July 31, 1993 Azkaban breakout. The group was initiated by Regulus Black, who had been planning this for years. 

• The group's primary objective was to free Sirius Black, Rophuldus Lestrange, Rastaban Lestrange, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Augustus Rookwood from Azkaban's high security track. Sirius was freed because he is innocent and Regulus brother, the other four were taken for their potential knowledge of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. [See More](https://prince-of-slytherin.fandom.com/wiki/Azkaban_Conspiracy)"
Wild Magic,"**Wild Magic** is Magic in its raw form, can be summed up in eight simple words: `'As I will it, so mote it be.'` Wizards have spent millennia striving to limit magic's potential, to ensure that magic is irrevocably linked to wands and incantations, defined as charms and transfigurations and potions, and restrained by the principles of arithmancy and runic matrices. The minute a compatible wand is picked up at Olivander's, those sparks that shot out represent the one's promise as a wizard that they would work magic according to the principles taught at magical schools, like Hogwarts. 
• *Accidental Magic is the simplest form of Wild Magic.* 
• It is theorized that **Wild Magic** is what is keeping Harry's scar from being identified as a Sowilō rune along with messing with a lot of other things in Harry's life. [See More](https://prince-of-slytherin.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Magic ""Wheels Within Wheels"")"
Memory Palace ,"**Memory palace**: After mastering the second level of occlumency, a wizard can begin constructing his Memory Palace. This is described as a psychic landscape in which all of your memories can be safeguarded and can be sued as a fortress against more powerful psychic attacks.

• Constructing a memory palace is one of the most difficult aspects of Occlumency training. It is based on a real-world location where you feel safe and in control of your surroundings. It should be cluttered like a library or a storage area. It is a place where you can imagine yourself leaving things behind to be picked up again later.

• Once properly developed can store your most sensitive memories in a partitioned area of your mind and can protect them with psychic traps capable of harming those who push too far. 

• A Memory palace can be used to store false personalities that can be draped over your true self

• False memory palaces can be created as Legilimancy traps to harm those who walk in. Jim gets trapped within Diary Riddle's memory palace 

• Vasyl Dobroshtan (from Beauxbatons) created a technique for embedding psychic attacks inside artwork designed to magically draw and hold the viewer's undivided attention. One of his creations was a *Cruciatus Curse* conveyed through art. Rufus Scrimgeour locked this image away in his Memory Palace and uses it to fight back against Rookwood during *The Fall of the House of Potter (Pt 1)*."
Ultimate Sanction (US),"**The Ultimate Sanction**, also known as *Sanctumen Ultimo*, is a provision of the Inheritance Act of 1588 that gives any Wizengamot House's Head the ability to disown a member of their House if the Head judges that the member has committed treason against their House or has committed actions that, if left unchallenged, threatens the survival of that House. 

When activated, the recipient will be forcefully removed from their House, with the recipient's surname becoming ""No-Name"", and losing any ties to their former house, including inheritance. [See More](https://prince-of-slytherin.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ultimate_Sanction)"

Parseltongue,"An ancient forbidden language spoken by a race of people that were unmade by magic. When Salazar Slytherin visited Sardeth in prison, he asked that Parseltongue be passed down to his heirs and preserved forever. If you do not happen to be an Heir of Slytherin (and thus cannot naturally speak it at birth), an inherent property of the language is to trigger a powerful fear reaction in those who hear it. Often just listening to it for extended periods of time prior to mastery will cause extreme psychological stress. (see `qd Sardeth`)"
Sardeth — The Last Naga,"Sardeth is forever barred from our world, imprisoned by Wild Magic. He is an impossible anomaly — the last survivor of a race which never existed. Reality itself rejects his existence as it undid his people as if they never existed.  (see `qd Wild Magic`)
Sardeth used forbidden rites to take himself beyond the guildhalls of Lares, out to the deepest parts of the Wild. There he performed the greatest Working of magic that made his very *language* magical. He wished that the naga could speak their desires and by the will and the word have it come to pass. As a result, reality strained and then buckled, and magic decided to wipe them from all of existence. He alone remains to tell the story to any who seek his blessing.

__Notable Visitors__
• Salazar Slytherin asked for Parseltongue to be passed down to his heirs and preserved forever. He feared Parseltongue would be completely lost over time. (see `qd Parseltongue`)
• Tom Riddle sought knowledge of how to more fully reject the humanity within himself. Sardeth provided him with knowledge of rituals that would transfigure him bodily to eventually gain naga features. 
• Ron Weasley accidentally finds his way to Sardeth’s prison and we learn that Ron’s greatest wish is to save the life of the Boy-Who-Lived, no matter the cost. Sardeth cannot grant a wish that will already come to pass, and instead rids Ron of his fear of spiders.

Occlumency,"Occlumency is the art of organizing and controlling your own mind. The basic art involves the ability to detect intrusive psychic attacks and defend against them. Those who study the art generally organize it into a 7 level tree, and at each level there are ancillary powers and effects that branch from the basic defensive power to provide other benefits.
A person who practises this art is known as an Occlumens
(See `qd Occlumency` for an entire list of Occlumency abilities by level)"
