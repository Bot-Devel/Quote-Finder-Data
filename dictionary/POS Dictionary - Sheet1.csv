THE POTTER PROPHECY,"*This is how our world will end 
In a cold yet all-consuming flame.*

*In the Last Days, a Dark Lord, the Darkest Lord, 
Will reveal himself as both Savior and Betrayer 
By proclaiming his forbidden lineage to all.*
 
*He will break the Chains of Unity that bond us and bind us. 
He will defy all conventions of sanity and compassion. 
He will shatter the foundations of our covenant.*

*And in so doing, the Dark Lord will become a Dark God, 
And all shall tremble at his Apotheosis. 
He will stretch forth his hand. 
And every wand will snap, 
Every incantation will be silenced, 
Until we shall all be as the lowliest squib.*

*Yet helplessness is not our worst Fate. 
For when the Cold Flame has consumed the World, 
The Last Enemy to be conquered shall be **Death**. 
And the Victor of that final struggle shall claim Dominion over all that is, 
Whether for Oblivion… or Damnation.*

*For should the Dark God win that final battle, 
Then our world will be reborn in his image. 
A world of hate, of fear, of despair. 
A world of suffering without end.*
 
*And we shall be reborn into this Nightmare World 
Again and again and again. 
Trapped forever throughout all our lives In the Dark God’s **HELL!***
 
*And you shall know by these portents 
That the time of the Dark God approaches 
And the Destruction of our World 
Is close at hand:*

*When the Two who should be as One 
Are set against each other in reckless hate. 
And the Last Potter rises as the Prince of Slytherin.* "
SYBILL TRELAWNEY'S PROPHECY,"*It will happen tonight. 
With all obstacles removed, 
the Prince will claim the Throne of Basalt and Silver. 
Though he is blameless, yet shall his actions be 
as the beating of the butterfly’s wings 
as they unleash the mightiest hurricane.* 

*By his choices shall the greatest of the Dark Lord’s servants 
be freed and the circle forged anew. 
The Dark Lord will be reborn in all his terrible glory. 
Betrayal. Blood. Terror. Destruction. Death. 
And finally, the Cold Flame that consumes all. 
Until at last, the Question is asked, and the Decision is made:* 

*Our story has been told before. But will it ever be told again?*"
DEMENTOR FABIAN'S PROMISE TO HARRY,"*“At the beginning of the end. When the tower falls, and hope falls with it. When the Three are rejoined to nestle within the coils of Ouroboros. Call my name, and I will come to you and walk with you unto the ending of the world”*"
VOW OF UNITY FOR THE WIZENGAMOT,"“Let Magic itself hear my oath and sanctify it. I stand in unity with the Wizengamot and the families both Noble and Ancient and Noble who are its foundation. Let my magic be bent to our collective purpose and so to the magic of my family and all who come after me lest they be forsworn and suffer expulsion. From the unification of my family magic with that of my peers, let there arise a deeper magic that is greater than the sum of its parts. From this day forward, I hereby submit myself to the will of the Wizengamot as expressed through its majority. I hereby accept the judgment of the will of the Wizengamot as expressed through its laws. I vow to act with the Wizengamot, and when we act as one, so shall we perform miracles in defense of and for the betterment of this magical nation. This I swear upon my life and unto the ending of the world. **So mote it be!**” "

OCCLUMENCY ABILITIES BY LEVEL,"__Occlumency Superpowers:__
Level 0: **Natural Occlumency Shields.** One out of twelve wizards are able to spontaneously develop shields in response to regular exposure to high level Legilimency attacks. They are comparable to the strength of a third-level Occlumens. 
Level 1: **Perfect recall** and shields strong enough to keep out all but the best Legilimens if you practice often enough
Level 2: **Mastering your emotions.** Emotional suppression and clarity. Able to detect intrusions into your mind, and able to mount a consistent defense. 
Level 3: **Understanding your emotions,** Recognizing when you are acting in response to emotional stimulus rather than rational decision-making. Thought stream partitioning, **Time dilation** (see `qd 2`)
Level 4: **Memory palace**(s) (see `qd 21`), **Advocatus diabolicus** (see `qd 1`)
Level 5: Secondary personalities that bear up under Legilimency scrutiny

__Esoteric Abilities/Extra Known Info:__
 • Being a **Natural Occlumens.** In which one wizard out of ten thousand gains the full benefits of Occlumency, the rarity is on par with being a natural Legilimens or a born Animagus. 
• Seven-stream thought arrays are common among DOM-trained Occlumens
• Rookwood's 49-stream matrix allowed him to bring himself back from being Tabula Rasa'd (see `qd 3`)
• Occlumency traps to psychically and physically injure Legilimens that may be rooting around in your brain
• A high-level Occlumens can fake a Veritaserum testimony, as they can alter their own memories.

*Note: Being an animagus is completely unrelated with being an Occlumens, But it can provide a useful substitute. During the early phases of learning an animagus form, the wizard develops a dual-process mind. He simultaneously thinks as both human and an animal which provides a powerful defense against Legilimency.*"
LIST OF KNOWN LEGILIMENCY SUPERPOWERS,"__Legilimency Superpowers:__
Like Occlumency, Legilimency is seven-tiered. However, does not have to be learned sequentially and instead is a cluster of closely-related skill sets, the most infamous of which allows the Legilimens to directly study the memories of another. 

• Mind-reading (stops requiring an incantation and a wand at Level 5)
• Deductive genius
• Supernatural charm and manipulation
• Covert conversations with other Legilimens
• Ward detection
• Psychic surgery (including Mind Healing and mental reprogramming)
• Psychic attacks"
COUNTESS ZABINI'S FOURTH BOOK READING,"""The cards I have just drawn to represent your recent past—*the Magician, the Emperor, the Sun, the World, and the Fool*—tell me that you have indeed come into your power and achieved the goals you had set for yourself when last I read your cards. Except that the Fool also tells me that you realized too late that achieving those goals might have been a terrible mistake. I suspect the fulfillment of an apocalyptic prophecy would fit that description.""

""Turning to the immediate future, we have the *Wheel of Fortune inverted, Justice inverted, Strength, the Hanged Man, and the Lovers inverted*. A dangerous conflict draws near, one you will be drawn into unfairly and against your will. And while you will succeed in the challenges you face, even those successes may redound to the benefit of your enemies.""
""You will also experience complications of a romantic nature which will threaten to distract you from more important concerns.""

""Looking farther ahead, we find *the Devil, the Hierophant inverted, the Hermit inverted, and the Tower*. A great evil rising against you, likely the same Dark Wizard who will one day become a Dark God. Perhaps Voldemort, perhaps someone else. You must be prepared for either possibility. You will experience both the loss of a powerful guardian figure and a time of forced seclusion spent cut off from your allies and forced to rely solely on yourself. And ultimately, a time of destruction and catastrophe.""

Finally, she pointed to the last two cards. ""All of which lead to the end of your journey: *Death and Judgment.*"""
LIST OF KNOWN HORCRUXES,"For a definition of how horcruxes are made in this fic (see `qd 10`)

1) **[The Locket (Deceased)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15833898/chapters/36870594)**: Improved the wearer's facility with Legilimency (see `qd 14`)

2) **[The Diary (Deceased)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15829326/chapters/36857841)**: Dumbledore's theory is that Voldemort first put his soul fragment inside the diary and then used it to give the diary self-awareness and a personality just different enough from his own that it could serve as Secret Keeper for a Fidelius, one that concealed the connection between Riddle and Voldemort. (see `qd 15`)

3) **[The Cup (Deceased)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15833898/chapters/47206327)**: A powerful healing device rumored to be able to greatly extend a wizard's life. (see `qd 16`)

4) **The Ring (Mentioned)**: Currently contained within a gold box (see `qd 12`)

5) **[The Diadem (Mentioned)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15829326/chapters/36857841)**: A Parselmouth who possessed the Ravenclaw Diadem could overcome the Basilisk's conditioning and use it against the Headmaster and the rest of the students. Whoever wears the diadem trumps normal parselmouths who might try to control the basilisk. 

6) **The Snake (Mentioned by TSM)**: ||""Nagini will be a horcrux, and she will NOT be a maledictus.  Nagini is not a normal snake and thus can be a viable horcrux host. She has been ... magically altered to be suitable as a horcrux.  Let's just leave it at that. I have plans for Nagini. They just don't include her secretly being a Korean witch.""||

THE 10 DEPARTMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES,"*Known Facts about the Department of Mysteries Include*
For DoM Chimes see (`qd 8`)

• There is a weekly Friday afternoon meeting for all Department Heads at the  Department of Mysteries Committee on Oversight

• The identities of each department are so well hidden that no other Department Head knows the identity of the others— even to the point of not knowing the others' gender, however it is implied that more perceptive members will be able to determine this

• When in a meeting only 'Control' is even aware of how many people are even actually present in the room. There are always at least 12 people present but many times the Heads *feel* there are more

• Also present at all meetings is Control and Unspeakable Number 7: aka Saul Croaker, Voice of the Unspeakables

• Many Department Heads have 'day jobs' that protect their identities and so would not even be known as Unspeakable to the public or their families

__Departments Include__
• Death
• Love - Known for their particular ill-temper (gender unknown/probable woman)
• Time - Unspeakable 17
• Space
• Mind - Philoctetes ""Phil"" Dippet- Court Reporter for the WZT by day
